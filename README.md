# ParkingApp

## Project setup
```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production
APIs are mocked for development purposes using MirageJs. So build package will not work.
```
npm run build
```

### Assumptions
* User is logged in
* User has entered the option to view Parkbee(26802): Botersloot
* It is a single flow so nothing is stored in localStorage or any DB
